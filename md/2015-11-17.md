We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong.
A day may begin well enough, but suddenly everything seems to get out of control.
What invaribly happens is that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the same moment.
It is as if a single unimportant event set up a chain of reactions.
Let us suppose you are reparing a meal and keepping an eyes on the baby at the same time.
The telephone rings and it marks the predule to an unforeseen series of catastrophes.
While you are on the phone, the baby pulls tablecloth off the table, smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process.
You hang up hurrily and attend to baby, crockery, etc. 
Meanwhile the meal gets burnt.
As if it were not enough to reduce you to tear, your husband arrives, unexceptedly bringing three guests to dinner.
