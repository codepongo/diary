Fish and chips **has always been**  a favourite dish in **Britain** , but as the
**ocean** have been overkilled, fish has become more and more expensive. So it 
comes as a surprise to **learn** that the **giant** fish were **terrifying** the 
divers on North Sea Oil rigs. Oil rigs have to be repair **frequently** and divers,
who **often** have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water, 
have been frightened out of their wiks by giant fish bumping into them as they work.
Now they have had special cages made to protect them from these **monsters**.
The fish were not sharks or killed whales, but favourite eating varieties like cod 
and skate which grow to unnatural sizes, sometimes as much as tewlve feet in length.
The three factors have caused that the fish to grow so large:the warm water round 
the hot oil pipes under the sea;the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the 
crews on the oil rigs; the total absence of fishing boats around oil rigs. As a result, 
the fish just eat and eat and grow and grown, in the lovely warm water. Who eats who.
