 an instance method is actually a curried static/class method composed of two
functions — one function that takes an instance, and another function that takes the parameters of the instance
method. 
class MyClass {
var s = ""
func store(s:String) {
self.s = s
}
}
let m = MyClass()
let f = MyClass.store(m) // what just happened!?
f("howdy")
print(m.s) // howdy

A subscript is like
a function in that it can take parameters: arguments can appear in the square brackets
when a subscript method is called. A subscript is like a computed property in that the call
is used like a reference to a property: you can fetch its value or you can assign into it

An enum is an object type whose instances represent distinct predefined alternative
values.

let instanceOfEnum: TypeOfEnum = .AlternativeOne

If the type is an integer numeric type,
the values can be implicitly assigned, and will start at zero by default. In this code,
.Mannie carries a value of  0 ,  .Moe carries of a value of  1 , and so on

If the type is String, the implicitly assigned values are the string equivalents of the case
names. In this code,  .Albums carries a value of  "Albums" , and so on

instanceOfEnum.rawValue
TypeOfEnum(rawValue:value)

An enum can have instance properties and static properties, but there’s a limitation: an
enum instance property can’t be a stored property. 

An enum instance method that modifies the enum itself must be marked as  mutating .
An enum is a switch whose states have names
